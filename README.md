# Algorithmic Trading Backtester

## Introduction
The Algorithmic Trading Backtester is a modular, extensible backtesting framework designed for algorithmic trading strategies. It allows traders and developers to build and test custom strategies in a flexible, plug-and-play architecture without being restricted to predefined methods or workflows. The backtester provides a core framework where each major component (strategies, data handlers, execution logic, and risk management) can be customized, swapped, or extended based on the userâ€™s specific needs.

The goal of this project is to create a backtester that emphasizes **modularity**, **scalability**, and **flexibility**, giving users full control over their strategies while offering powerful tools to analyze results through in-depth reports and visualizations.

## Installation

To install the backtester, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backtester.git
cd backtester
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Getting Started
Here's an example of a basic backtest using the modular architecture:

```python
from backtester import Backtester, Strategy, DataHandler, ExecutionHandler, RiskManager

class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def generate_signals(self, data):
        # User-defined signal generation logic
        return signals

data_handler = DataHandler(tickers=['AAPL'], start_date='2020-01-01', end_date='2023-01-01')
execution_handler = ExecutionHandler(transaction_cost=0.001)
risk_manager = RiskManager()

strategy = MyStrategy()

backtester = Backtester(data_handler, strategy, execution_handler, risk_manager)
backtester.run()
```
