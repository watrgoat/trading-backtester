# Algorithmic Trading Strategy Backtester

## Overview
A Python-based backtesting framework to implement and analyze algorithmic trading strategies.

## Features
### **1. Modular Strategy Interface**
- **Description:** Create a standardized interface or abstract base class that allows users to define and plug in their own trading strategies effortlessly.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Encourages flexibility and extensibility.
  - Simplifies the integration of diverse strategies without modifying the core backtester.
- **Implementation Tips:** Use Python’s `ABC` module to define abstract methods like `generate_signals()` that each strategy must implement.

### **2. Comprehensive Data Handling**
- **Description:** Implement functionality to import and preprocess financial data from various sources such as CSV files and APIs like `yfinance`.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Ensures the backtester can work with different data formats and sources.
  - Handles data cleaning tasks like missing values and resampling.
- **Implementation Tips:** Utilize `pandas` for data manipulation and provide utility functions for common preprocessing steps.

### **3. Portfolio and Position Management**
- **Description:** Develop mechanisms to manage portfolio state, including tracking cash, holdings, and overall portfolio value over time.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Accurately reflects the impact of trades on the portfolio.
  - Facilitates realistic simulation of trading scenarios.
- **Implementation Tips:** Maintain separate variables or data structures for cash balance, open positions, and total portfolio value, updating them based on trade executions.

### **4. Execution of Buy/Sell Orders with Basic Transaction Costs**
- **Description:** Implement order execution logic that processes buy and sell signals, incorporating simple transaction cost models like fixed fees or percentage-based commissions.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Adds realism by accounting for trading costs.
  - Helps in evaluating net strategy performance.
- **Implementation Tips:** Apply transaction costs directly when updating cash and portfolio values upon trade execution.

### **5. Performance Metrics Calculation**
- **Description:** Calculate key performance indicators such as Total Return, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and Win/Loss Ratio.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Provides quantitative measures to assess strategy effectiveness.
  - Facilitates comparison between different strategies.
- **Implementation Tips:** Use `numpy` and `pandas` to compute these metrics from the portfolio’s return series.

### **6. Equity Curve and Trade Visualization**
- **Description:** Generate visual plots of the equity curve (portfolio value over time) and mark trade entries and exits on price charts.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Enhances interpretability of backtest results.
  - Aids in identifying patterns and potential issues in strategy performance.
- **Implementation Tips:** Utilize `matplotlib` or `plotly` to create clear and informative visualizations, including annotations for trade points.

### **7. Logging and Reporting**
- **Description:** Implement logging mechanisms to record trade details, performance metrics, and any errors or warnings during backtesting.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Provides transparency and traceability of the backtest process.
  - Facilitates debugging and performance analysis.
- **Implementation Tips:** Use Python’s built-in `logging` module to create log files, and generate summary reports in formats like Markdown or HTML.
