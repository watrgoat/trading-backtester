# TODO

## General Package Updates

- [ ] Refactor core `Backtester` to support component-based architecture with modular strategies, risk management, and execution handlers.
- [ ] Implement abstract interfaces for `Strategy`, `RiskManager`, `ExecutionHandler`, and `DataHandler` to allow user-defined components.

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Modularity (Core Focus)
- [ ] Define a clear interface for all major components (strategies, execution handlers, risk managers, etc.).
- [ ] Enable users to plug in and swap out custom components without modifying core backtester code.
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with external libraries for easy integration of user-defined logic.

### 2. In-Depth Reports and Visualizations
- [ ] Build customizable report generation for key performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, volatility, and drawdown.
- [ ] Integrate Plotly/Bokeh for interactive visualizations.
- [ ] Add support for trade-level analysis and risk-adjusted performance metrics.

### 3. Multi-Asset Class and Portfolio-Level Backtesting
- [ ] Support strategies that operate across multiple asset classes (stocks, crypto, forex, futures).
- [ ] Implement dynamic portfolio rebalancing based on risk tolerance and position sizing.
- [ ] Extend `DataHandler` to ingest data from various sources and asset classes.

### 4. Scalability and Parallelization (Later Expansion)
- [ ] Implement parallel backtesting using `multiprocessing` or `asyncio` for large-scale strategy tests.
- [ ] Allow batch testing of multiple strategies simultaneously.
- [ ] Build scalable data handling and caching mechanisms to support large datasets and high-frequency strategies.

### 5. Strategy Debugging and Step-by-Step Simulation
- [ ] Implement a detailed debugging mode with step-by-step execution of trades.
- [ ] Add conditional breakpoints for specific strategy conditions (e.g., large drawdowns).
- [ ] Generate detailed logs for each trade decision, including rationale and market state at the time.

### 6. Advanced Risk Management and Hedging
- [ ] Build support for dynamic position sizing based on risk metrics (volatility, drawdown, VaR).
- [ ] Implement advanced order types like stop-loss, trailing stops, and conditional orders.
- [ ] Allow for hedging strategies using derivatives (options, futures) and simulate the impact of these hedges on the portfolio.

### 7. Documentation and Example Library
- [ ] Write detailed documentation explaining the core functions and providing examples for custom components.
- [ ] Create a library of example strategies and templates focused on algorithmic trading.
- [ ] Provide interactive tutorials using Jupyter notebooks to guide users through building and testing strategies.
